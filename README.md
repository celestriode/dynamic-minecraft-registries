# Dynamic Minecraft Registries

Multitude of registry shells to be populated through dynamic populators (see [celestriode/dynamic-registry](https://github.com/celestriode/dynamic-registry)). Used in contexts where the actual data depends on both edition and version. Each registry gets its own populator.
